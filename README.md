Pan Bubr's Advent of Code 2020 solutions
=========================================

This year, I am planning to do the full [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/) in Rust and Python. 

After hitting a wall, I'll try to continue using Typescript - my main language.

# Test Solutions

## Rust
1. Enter rust directory `cd rust`
2. Run cargo with input passed in stdin `cargo run d01 < input.txt`
3. You can also test your input via stdin ended with EOF signal
```
    cargo run d1
        10
        20
        30
        [CTRL+D]
```

## Python
1. Run python code with input.txt as a first argument
```
    python3 python/d1.py inputs/1.txt
```

## Typescript
